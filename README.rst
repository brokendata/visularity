Visularity
==========

Similarity cluster visualization
--------------------------------

Visularity does not come with any of the data needed to do similarity comparison (e.g., transformation models and
dictionaries). This data is generally application-specific and also large (think hundreds of megabytes).
Visit radimrehurek.com/gensim to learn how to generate data. It's not that hard.

Requires:
 * flask
 * requests
 * gensim (including models and a dictionary)
 * numpy and scipy
 * hookbox
